## Requirements
As the server is running on a Docker container, make sure to first install Docker.

You can choose to install Docker with <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker Desktop</a> or a CLI.

## Installation
Once Docker is installed, run Docker.

To run the server, first build the container. Go to the root directory of the repository and run:
```
docker compose up --build
```
The command will build and run the container for the first time.
